## Conspicuity Detection in Production: A Quantum Approach (4 Weeks)

This project explores using **quantum computing** to improve production efficiency. Here's the gist:

* **Problem:** Traditional methods for analyzing production data (images, time series) to identify inefficiencies are slow.
* **Solution:** We'll use **hybrid quantum computing**, combining classical and quantum techniques, to potentially speed up this process.
* **Focus:** Implementing and comparing quantum algorithms against classical methods like machine learning.
* **Project Duration:** 4 weeks (July 5th - August 9th, 2024)

**Project Tasks:**

1. **Get Quantum Ready:** Learn the basics of **PennyLane**, a popular quantum computing library. This involves understanding qubits, gates, and building quantum circuits.
2. **Master Quantum Machine Learning:** Build a simple quantum classifier model using PennyLane. This will solidify your understanding of applying machine learning in a quantum setting.
3. **Level Up with Quanvolutional Neural Networks:** Explore a more complex model called a Quanvolutional Neural Network (inspired by Convolutional Neural Networks) using a real-world dataset of handwritten digits (MNIST). This will push your skills in implementing and understanding advanced quantum algorithms.

**Benefits:**

* Gain hands-on experience with quantum computing.
* Learn how quantum algorithms can solve real-world problems.
* Compete for Womanium grants and fellowships.
